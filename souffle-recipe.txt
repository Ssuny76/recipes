<Ingredients>
-4 egg whites
-3/4 cup of all-purpose flour (or cake flour)
-1 tsp of baking powder
-a pinch of salt
-2 egg yolks
-1/4 cup of sugar
-1/2 cup of milk

TOPPINGS:
-Maple syrup
-Strawberries or bananas
-Butterrrr 

<Directions>
1. In a large bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer. Mix until peaks form, where the egg whites go straight up firmly when you lift up the whisk. If you over-beat it, they will break into pieces and will need a new batch. If you under-beat, the souffle pancakes will not be as fluffy as ideal. 
2. In another bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, egg yolks, the sugar, and milk.
3. The secret to getting extra fluffy souffle pancakes is the egg white mix that was made into a meringue. When folding in the egg white to the pancake mix, make sure not to overmix.
4. Grease metal rings and place in the center of the pan. Set it to a very low heat, so that you can take control of the souffle pancake's texture (also a good way to avoid the batter being too raw). 
5. Fill the mould to 75% capacity as the souffle pancakes will expand. Cover the pan and cook for about 10 minutes. The outside should be golden. The safest way is to cover with a lid to keep the heat spread evenly in the pan as well as to make sure there is enough moisture locked in the pancake. (That is another reason why it becomes fluffy.)
6. Carefully turn over the souffle pancakes with a spatula. Cover again and cook for 5 minutes.
7. Once they are cooked, yet still jiggly, there are ready! Enjoy your beautiful creation!
